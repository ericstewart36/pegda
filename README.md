# PEG-DA hydrogel code
This repository contains an example code for the finite element implementation of the large deformation thermodynamically-consistent chemo-mechanical theory I developed for modeling the pressure-dependent infiltration of water into PEG-DA hydrogels. 

Specifically, the repository contains the relevant FEniCS code and experimental data file for the free swelling study presented in the paper, which is available here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352431622001018.

I have also included a .pdf document describing the major aspects of my approach to the numerical implementation of the theory in FEniCS.
